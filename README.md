# CZ1007: Data Structures

## Learning Outcome

### First Half
* **Understand** the abstract design and practical implementation of data structures
* **Select** and **apply** appropriate data structures for a given requirement
* **Visualize** the data structures created
* Capable of **proposing** new data structures
* **Implement** software to solve real-world problems using data structures

### Second Half
* Understand what the tools are for **storing** and **processing** common data types
* Understand which tools are appropriate for which need
* To make **good design choices** as a developer, project manager, or system customer
* Able to **justify** design decisions
* Able to **communicate** ideas about programs clearly and precisely

## Coursework Assignment
Implementation of code for a given set of data structure related questions. Tasks include implementation of : 

- a function that aims to ``sort`` the items in the ``linkedlist`` in the ascending order.
- a function that aims to move all the odd items in a linkedlist to the back and the even items, to the front
- a function that aims to ``create`` a ``Queue`` based on the items from a linkedlist. 
- a function that aims to remove all the odd items from the Queue
- a function that aims to print the items in a ``Binary Search Tree`` in post-order manner by using ``iterative method`` with ``two stacks``

## Knowledge Accquired includes: 

1. Basic Constructs in C program structure, Syntax and semantics

2. Built-in Data Structures

3. Recursion

3. Memory Management in C

4. Linked Lists

5. Stacks and Queues

6. Tree Structures

7. Implementing other data abstractions

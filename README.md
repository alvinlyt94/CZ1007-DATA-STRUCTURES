# CZ1007 : Data Structures

## Learning Outcome

### First Half
* **Understand** the abstract design and practical implementation of data structures
* **Select** and **apply** appropriate data structures for a given requirement
* **Visualize** the data structures created
* Capable of **proposing** new data structures
* **Implement** software to solve real-world problems using data structures

### Second Half
* Understand what the tools are for **storing** and **processing** common data types
* Understand which tools are appropriate for which need
* To make **good design choices** as a developer, project manager, or system customer
* Able to **justify** design decisions
* Able to **communicate** ideas about programs clearly and precisely

## Coursework Assignment
Implementation of code for a given set of data structure related questions. Tasks include implementation of : 

Functions that aims to :
* sort the items in the ``linkedlist`` in the ascending order
* move all the odd items in a ``linkedlist`` to the back and vice versa
* ``create`` a ``Queue`` based on the items from a ``linkedlist``
* remove all the odd items from the ``Queue``
* print the items in a ``Binary Search Tree (BST)`` in post-order manner by using iterative method with two stacks
